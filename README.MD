TODO: add meaningful user-agent header for the query

TODO: describe fetch-update part of the app

TODO: describe api part of the app

TODO: explain that value names in sparql are arbitrarily set by the query itself and all the typings and processing functions follow that naming. Changing the query may require changing that parts of code or else the app will not work anymore

The app was setup based on this [guide](https://medium.com/@gabrieldrouin/node-js-2025-guide-how-to-setup-express-js-with-typescript-eslint-and-prettier-b342cd21c30d) for an express + typescript + eslint + prettier app.
